However, it focuses on the development aspect of it, not much on the operations.\n\nThe session will cover best practices for running CAP Node.js applications in SAP BTP. How should you configure your application's package.json? What else you should add to your .mta file? What issues you may face if these best practices are not implemented? What benefits will it bring?\n\nThe examples will target deployments to Cloud Foundry, but they apply to both Cloud Foundry and Kyma/Kubernetes environments.",

    description:
      "In CAP development, the Draft feature of CAP Services offers significant support for developers and end users. However, the recommended best practice of creating a separate service for each use case introduces an unexpected pitfall: Drafts are service-specific and thus isolated, limiting visibility across different services. This isolation can lead to issues, as users in different apps accessing various services cannot benefit from the Draft functionality. This may even lead to a deceptive sense of security that risks unnoticed overwrites of changes.\n\nIn this talk, we address this challenge and present a pragmatic solution approach, which we consider a workaround, since it adds additional unwanted complexity. \n\nOur aim is to spark a lively discussion and explore more sustainable solutions with the audience. We will explore how this workaround can be implemented to make the Draft functionality usable across multiple services, while minimizing risks to data consistency and security. \n\nCode that will be used in the presentation builds on the NodeJS implementation of CAP. The Java implementation may or may not have the same issue.",

      "UI5 applications in CAP projects usually are not standalone applications without external dependencies. They often use libraries, controls, components, or external third-party libraries. With the addition of TypeScript, middleware, or other custom steps, the development environment quickly becomes complex and cluttered. Including backend development with CAP, it gets challenging to manage all dependencies and maintain a good development environment.\n\nFortunately, a lot has happened in this area over the last year to make development easier for developers. New open-source tools have been developed that help developers manage dependencies easily and quickly and in developing libraries/components/UI5 apps with a CAP backend.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the latest tools and technologies that make it simpler and faster to develop UI5 applications and CAP backends. Using a realistic scenario, we will show how to set up a project with UI5 apps libraries and a CAP backend, and how developers are supported in this process.\n\nAdditionally, we will demonstrate the options for deploying the components and how the applications can be operated in the BTP cloud.",

With a focus on load balancing, this package ensures optimal event distribution across all available application instances. By providing managed transactions similar to CAP handlers, the Event-Queue plugin simplifies event processing, enhancing the overall performance of your application.\n\nAdditionally, Event-Queue provides support for periodic events, allowing for processing at defined intervals. This feature further extends its capabilities in load balancing and transaction management, ensuring that even regularly occurring tasks are handled efficiently and effectively without overloading any single instance. This makes it an ideal solution for applications needing consistent, reliable event processing.\n\nLearn in this session how to use this plugin in your project!",
